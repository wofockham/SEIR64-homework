            <h1>Yukihiro Matsumoto</h1>
            <p>Yukihiro Matsumoto (まつもとゆきひろ, Matsumoto Yukihiro, born 14 April 1965), the creator of Ruby, is a professional programmer who worked for the Japanese open source company, netlab.jp. Matz is also known as one of the open source evangelists in Japan. He's released several open source products, including cmail, the emacs-based mail user agent, written entirely in emacs lisp. Ruby is his first piece of software that has become known outside of Japan.</p>

    <h1>About Ruby!</h1>
    <p>Ruby is an open-source object-oriented scripting language invented in the mid-90s by Yukihiro Matsumoto.</p>

    <p>Unlike languages such as C and C++, a scripting language doesn't talk directly to hardware. It's written to a text file and then parsed by an interpreter and turned into code. These programs are generally procedural in nature, meaning they are read from top to bottom.</p>
    <p>Object-oriented languages, on the other hand, break out pieces of code into objects that can be created and used as needed. You can reuse these objects in other parts of the program, or even other applications.</p>

    <p>Yukihiro wanted to create a scripting language that leveraged object-oriented programming and increase code reuse to help speed up development. And so the Ruby programming language was born, using simple language and syntax to handle data and logic to solve problems.</p>

<!-- Requirements
At least 3 pages (example: biography, trivia, hometown)
At least 1 Google Font
Whatever HTML and CSS you desire
Keep your code clean and DRY
Start working with semantic elements: http://html5doctor.com/lets-talk-about-semantics/
No Javascript! Even if you know how to use jQuery, see how far you can push this with pure HTML + CSS
Don't worry about responsiveness -- desktop resolution is fine
Your research should aim to reveal at least two things about each person:
Why Joel admires them
Something Joel doesn't already know about them
Optional extras
Experiment with http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/
Record and embed a short podcast or vlog about your favourite scientist
Try embedding other media (YouTube or Vimeo video, Soundcloud)
Try embedding a Google map (for their hometown and/or alma mater) -->
