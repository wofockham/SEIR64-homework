            <h3>Matz was 17yrs old when he began writing his first language.</h3>
            <p>In the early 1980s. Matz began writing his own language on a notebook. Though this first language was not Ruby, Matz compares it to Pascal and Lisp which inspired many of the features in Ruby nearly a decade later. Unfortunately he lost his notebook.</p>

            <h3>It took 6 months to build and write the tools necessary to write “Hello world” in Ruby.</h3>
            <p>It was February of 1993 when he started implementing the programming language, which required implementing the entire object system, object class, string class and IO streams. In August he was finally able to write the line of code producing “Hello world”.</p>

        <div class="facts">
            <h3>Google's “Did you mean…” feature was inspiration for Ruby's helpful error messages that Rubyists love.</h3>
            <p>Matz said he liked the idea of a compiler making a helpful suggestion to fix the error. He liked the idea of a conversation and exchange that lead to solutions rather than feeling like his computer was shouting at him.</p>
