                <h3>quotes from Grace Hopper</h3>
                <p>"To me programming is more than an important practical art. It is also a gigantic undertaking in the foundations of knowledge."</p>
                <p>"The only phrase I’ve ever disliked is, ‘Why, we’ve always done it that way.’ I always tell young people, ‘Go ahead and do it. You can always apologize later."</p>
                <p>"A ship in port is safe, but that’s not what ships are built for."</p>
                <p>"If you do something once, people will call it an accident. If you do it twice, they call it a coincidence. But do it a third time and you’ve just proven a natural law!"</p>
                <p>"I’ve always been more interested in the future than in the past"</p>

                <h3>Did you know these?</h3>
                <p>At the age of seven, she decided to determine how an alarm clock worked and dismantled seven alarm clocks before her mother realized what she was doing.</p>
                <p>Though Hopper invented a foundation of English based programming language, her Latin score at school made her rejected for an early admission to a college. She was admitted the following year.</p>
                <p>Her initial application to enlist in the Navy was refused due partly to her age and weight.</p>
