                <p>Grace Brewster Hopper (née Murray; December 9, 1906 – January 1, 1992) was an American computer scientist, mathematician, and United States Navy rear admiral. She was one of the firs programmers of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_Mark_I" target="_blank">Harvard Mark I computer</a>. Before joining teh Navy, She eraned a Ph.D. in mathmatics and worked as a professor of mathematics.</p>
                <p>Hoper was a pioneer of computer programming and is a parent of the theory of machine-independent programming langauge. This has made progrraming more accessible for people like me who gets muted hearig aobut mathematics.</p>
                <p>Highly motivated, Hopper managed the development of one of the first  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COBOL" target="_blank">COBOL compilers.</a> She believed that a programming language based on English was possible. Her compiler converted English terms into machine code understood by computers.</p>
                <p>Hopper retired from the Naval reserve in 1966 at the age of 60, but was called in for active duty in the following year. She retired again in 1971, and then was asked to return in the following year. She was on active duty until 1986, 20 years after she initially retired.</p>
