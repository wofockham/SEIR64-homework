            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>John von Neumann was a Hungarian-American mathematician, physicist, computer scientist, and polymath who
                made
                significant contributions to numerous fields during his lifetime.</p>
            <p>He is perhaps best known for his work on the development of the modern computer, including his invention
                of
                the Von Neumann architecture, which is still used in computer design today.</p>
            <p>Von Neumann also made contributions to the fields of game theory, quantum mechanics, and economics, among
                others. He was a prolific author and lecturer, and his work continues to be studied and applied in many
                fields today.</p>
