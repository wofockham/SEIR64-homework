            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>John von Neumann was a Hungarian-American mathematician, physicist, and computer scientist who made
                significant contributions to a wide range of fields, including mathematics, physics, economics, game
                theory, and computer science.</p>
            <p>He was born on December 28, 1903, in Budapest, Hungary, and showed an early aptitude for mathematics. He
                earned a Ph.D. in mathematics from the University of Budapest at the age of 22.</p>
            <p>In 1930, he emigrated to the United States, where he began working at Princeton University. During World
                War II, he worked on the Manhattan Project, which developed the first atomic bomb.</p>
            <p>Von Neumann made important contributions to the development of game theory, the mathematical foundations
                of quantum mechanics, and the concept of the stored-program computer.</p>
