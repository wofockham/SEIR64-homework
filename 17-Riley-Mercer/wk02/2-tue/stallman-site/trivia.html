    <p> I would imagine that Joel admires RMS for his commitment to open software standards and love of tech-autonomy (have not taken into account his extensive contributions to comp science (if that was important to this question surely Linus Torvalds would have made the lsit?)). </p>
    <p>I assume Joel knows this, but I cannot help but point out that Stallman's personal website is entirely devoid of css.</p>
    <p>I do not know if Joel knows however, that Stallman has written a protest poem about Reagan. It reads as follows:</p>
    <h2>My Ronnie</h2>
<p>My Ronnie lies over the radio.</p>
<p>My Ronnie lies over TV.</p>
<p>My Ronnie lies over and over.</p>
<p>What has he done to my country? </p>
