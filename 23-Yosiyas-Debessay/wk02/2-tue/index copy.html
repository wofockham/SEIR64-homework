            <h3>About</h3>
            <p class="cardWord">Donald Knuth is a renowned computer scientist and mathematician who is widely known for his contributions to the field of computer science. He is the author of the seminal multi-volume work "The Art of Computer Programming," which is considered a classic in the field. He is also known for developing the TeX computer typesetting system, which is widely used for typesetting technical and scientific documents, as well as the Metafont font-creation system.</p>

           <h3>About</h3>
           <p class="cardWord">Knuth received a bachelor’s degree in mathematics in 1960 from the Case Institute of Technology (now Case Western Reserve University) in Cleveland, Ohio, and his work was so impressive that he was awarded a simultaneous master’s degree. He then earned a doctorate in mathematics in 1963 from the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, California, where he was an assistant and then associate professor from 1963 to 1968.</p>

           <h3>About</h3>
           <p class="cardWord">While still in graduate school, the publishing company Addison-Wesley approached Knuth to write a book on compilers. Knuth instead wrote a first draft of a general survey of computer programming. Addison-Wesley decided that Knuth’s draft should be expanded into seven volumes, and the first volume of The Art of Computer Programming was published in 1968.</p>

           <h3>About</h3>
           <p class="cardWord">Knuth became a professor of computer science at Stanford University in 1968. In the late 1970s Addison-Wesley changed its typesetting from traditional metal typesetting to a process based on photographic reproduction. Knuth thought the photographic process was of poor quality. However, he then saw the high quality that could be produced with digital typesetting and took time out from writing The Art of Computer Programming to develop TeX, a document-preparation system.</p>

           <h3>Why Joel Admires Him</h3>
           <p class="cardWord">I think Joel admires Donald Knuth because of his commitment and dedication to his work. He is known for his meticulous attention to detail and his insistence on precision and accuracy, which is reflected in his work on "The Art of Computer Programming" and other projects. Despite the complexity, he always strived to make his work accessible and understandable to everyone, and has encouraged a culture of collaboration and open communication in the field. This dedication has made him a role model in the field of computer science and beyond.</p>

           <h3>Fact</h3>
           <p class="cardWord">One fact that I think Joel wouldn't know about Donald Knuth is that he has a passion for music and is an accomplished organist. He has been playing the organ since he was a teenager and has performed in concerts throughout his career. Knuth has also composed several pieces of music for the organ, including "Fantasia Apocalyptica," which is inspired by the Book of Revelation in the Bible. Despite his busy schedule, he continues to make time for music and has even integrated his love for music into his work, such as using musical notation in his books to explain algorithms.</p>

        <h1>Donald Knuth</h1>
        <p>Donald Knuth, in full Donald Ervin Knuth, (born January 10, 1938, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, U.S.), American mathematician and computer scientist known for his authoritative multivolume series of books The Art of Computer Programming (1968– ) and the text-formatting language TeX.</p>

        <p>Knuth received a bachelor’s degree in mathematics in 1960 from the Case Institute of Technology (now Case Western Reserve University) in Cleveland, Ohio, and his work was so impressive that he was awarded a simultaneous master’s degree.

Knuth thought the photographic process was of poor quality. However, he then saw the high quality that could be produced with digital typesetting and took time out from writing The Art of Computer Programming to develop TeX, a document-preparation system. Because of its precise control of special characters and mathematical formulas, TeX and its variants soon became standard for submitting typeset-ready scientific and mathematical research papers for publication.</p>
