                    <span class="bold">Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace</span> (n√©e Byron; 10 December 1815 - 27 November 1852) was an English mathematician and writer, chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage's proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. She was the first to recognise that the machine had applications beyond pure calculation, and to have published the first algorithm intended to be carried out by such a machine. As a result, she is often regarded as the first computer programmer. <a class="read-more" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace" target="_blank">Read more...</a>

                    From 1832, when she was seventeen, her mathematical abilities began to emerge, and her interest in mathematics dominated the majority of her adult life. Her mother's obsession with rooting out any of the insanity of which she accused Byron (Ada's father) was one of the reasons that Ada was taught mathematics from an early age. She was privately educated in mathematics and science by William Frend, William King, and Mary Somerville, the noted 19th-century researcher and scientific author. In the 1840s, the mathematician Augustus De Morgan extended her "much help in her mathematical studies" including study of advanced calculus topics including the "numbers of Bernoulli" (that formed her celebrated algorithm for Babbage's Analytical Engine). In a letter to Lady Byron, De Morgan suggested that Ada's skill in mathematics might lead her to become "an original mathematical investigator, perhaps of first-rate eminence".<a class="read-more" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace" target="_blank"> Read more...</a>

                <h3>The Enchantress of Numbers</h3>
                <p>
                    She conjures numbers in the night;<br>
                    they bow and dance before their queen,<br>
                    who labours hard by candle-light<br>
                    at work the world has not yet seen.<br>
                    She brings the futere into sight<br>
                    and contemplates the new machine.<br>
                    <br>
                    The digits fall beneath her spell,<br>
                    no less in beauty than an ode;<br>
                    her father's child, she knows so well<br>
                    imagination's open road.<br>
                    It leads where only time will tell,<br>
                    this magic trail she lays with code.<br>
                    <br>
