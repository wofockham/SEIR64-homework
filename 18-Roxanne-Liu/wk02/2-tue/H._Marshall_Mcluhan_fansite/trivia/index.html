      </h3>
      <p>While studying at the University of Cambridge in England in the late 1930s, McLuhan began developing an interest in converting to Roman Catholicism.  In the years before 1937, he was agnostic.  But he encountered the work of G.K. Chesterton and this inspired his decision to convert.  By 1937, McLuhan completed his conversion to Roman Catholicism.</p>
      <p>Throughout the rest of his life, McLuhan had an interest in the Holy Trinity, as well as the Trivium, which is made up of grammar, logic and rhetoric.  His 1942 Cambridge doctoral dissertation was on the history of the trivium.</p>
