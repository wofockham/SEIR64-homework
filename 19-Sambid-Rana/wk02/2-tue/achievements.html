                <h2>1960's</h2>
                <p>
                    Throughout Fran's storied career, she developed a number of breakthrough programming-language
                    compilers
                    In the early 1960s, Fran led a team of researchers that designed one of the first supercomputers,
                    the
                    Stretch Harvest—for the U.S. National Security Agency. The machine could decrypt messages using
                    three
                    different programming languages: FORTRAN, Autocoder, and Alpha. <br><br>

                    She also designed and built the machine-independent, language-independent optimizing component of
                    the
                    Experimental Compiler for IBM's Advanced Computing System. The code helped drive technological
                    improvements of hardware design, and it created a new way to analyze and transform programs. Allen
                    wrote
                    a seminal paper, “Program Optimization,” first published internally at IBM in 1966. It describes a
                    robust new framework for implementing program analysis and optimization as well as a powerful set of
                    new
                    algorithms.

            <h2>1989</h2>
            <h3>Becoming IBM's First Female Fellow</h3>
            <p>
                Fran became the first woman to become an IBM Fellow, receiving the company's highest technical
                distinction in 1989. Fran was not the first woman at IBM Research; in fact, she was one of many. “Later,
                as computing emerged as a specialized field, employers began to require engineering credentials, which
                traditionally attracted few women. But the pendulum is swinging back as women enter the field from other
                areas such as medical informatics, user interfaces and computers in education.”

                <h3 id="headthree-three">Turing Award</h3>


                <p id="para-three">
                    In 2006, the Association for Computing Machinery named Fran the recipient of the A.M. Turing Award
                    for
                    contributions that fundamentally improved the performance of computer programs in solving problems,
                    and
                    accelerated the use of high performance computing. As significant, it marked the first time a woman
                    had
                    received this honor. The Turing Award is widely considered the "Nobel Prize in Computing."

                    Fran's contributions also extended earlier work in automatic program parallelization, which allows
                    programs to use multiple processors simultaneously in order to obtain faster results. These
                    techniques
                    have made it possible to achieve high performance from computers while programming them in languages
                    suitable to applications. They have contributed to advances in the use of high performance computers
                    for
                    solving problems such as weather forecasting, DNA matching, and national security functions
