                One of the few women in the computer industry in its early days, she paved the way for the efficient, lightning-fast apps of today.

                The world knows of Fortran's revolutionary success, but is less familiar with the role played by the compiler software used to translate users' problem-solving language statements into more efficient sequences of instructions for the most powerful computers.

                Together with the researcher John Cocke, she published a series of landmark papers in the late 1960s and 70s describing this delicate balance between ease of creation and speed of execution. These ideas helped drive the evolution of computer programming — all the way to the present day, when even relative novices can easily build fast and efficient software apps for a world of computers, smartphones and other devices.
