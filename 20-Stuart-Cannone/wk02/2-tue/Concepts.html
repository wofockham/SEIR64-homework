        <h2>Turing Machine</h2>
        <p>The Turing Machine is a theoretical model of a simple computing device that was proposed by Alan Turing in 1936. It is a thought experiment that explores the nature and limits of computation. The Turing machine is a theoretical construct that is used to understand the principles of computation and to investigate the concept of an algorithm.</p>
        <h2>Turing Test</h2>
        <p>The Turing Test is a method proposed by Alan Turing in 1950 to test a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior that is indistinguishable from that of a human. The Turing Test involves a human evaluator engaging in a natural language conversation with a machine and a human, without knowing which is which. The machine is said to have passed the test if the evaluator cannot reliably distinguish between the machine and the human based on their responses.</p>
        <h2>Turing completeness</h2>
        <p>Alan Turing proposed the concept of Turing completeness, which is a measure of a system's ability to perform any computation that can be performed by a Turing machine. A system that is Turing complete is said to be capable of performing any computation that can be performed by any other computer.</p>

    <h2>Trivia</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>What is the name of the chemical castration treatment that Alan Turing was subjected to after being convicted of homosexuality in 1952?
        Answer: The chemical castration treatment that Alan Turing was subjected to was called "chemical hormone treatment," which involved the injection of synthetic estrogen to reduce his libido.</li>
    <li>What was the name of the mathematical problem that Alan Turing proved to be unsolvable, even with the aid of a Turing machine?
        Answer: The problem was called the Halting Problem.</li>
    <li>What was the name of the computing device that Alan Turing designed and built at the age of 16, before he had even entered college?
        Answer: The device was called the Universal Machine.</li>
