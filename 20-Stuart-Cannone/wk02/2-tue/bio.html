        <h2>Bio</h2>
        <p>Alan Turing (1912-1954) was a British mathematician, logician, and computer scientist, who is widely considered to be one of the most influential figures in the development of modern computing.</p>
        <p>Turing was born in London and grew up in a privileged family. He studied mathematics at King's College, Cambridge, and later joined the Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park, where he worked on cracking German ciphers during World War II. Turing's work played a critical role in the Allied victory, and his code-breaking efforts are estimated to have shortened the war by several years.</p>
        <p>After the war, Turing continued to work on computer science and artificial intelligence, and developed the concept of the Universal Turing Machine, which is considered to be the theoretical basis for all modern computers. He also proposed the famous Turing Test, which tests a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior that is indistinguishable from that of a human.</p>
        <p>Despite his many contributions to science and technology, Turing was persecuted for his homosexuality, which was then illegal in the UK. He was convicted of indecency in 1952, and was forced to undergo chemical castration. Turing tragically died of cyanide poisoning two years later, in what is widely believed to have been a suicide.</p>
        <p>In recent years, Turing's contributions to computer science and cryptography have been increasingly recognized and celebrated. In 2009, then-UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown issued an apology on behalf of the British government for the way Turing was treated. Turing's legacy continues to inspire and influence modern technology, and he is remembered as a brilliant scientist and mathematician who made a profound impact on the world.</p>
