        <h2>BOMBE</h2>
        <p>Alan Turing is best known for designing and developing the machine that cracked the Enigma code used by the Germans during World War II. This machine was called the Bombe. The Bombe was an electromechanical device that used rotating drums and a series of electrical connections to decipher encrypted messages. It was designed to search through millions of possible settings to find the correct ones that would decode the messages. The successful cracking of the Enigma code played a critical role in the Allied victory in World War II.</p>
        <p>The name "Bombe" was inspired by an earlier machine developed by Polish cryptanalysts, called the "Bomba". The Polish Bomba was an electromechanical machine used for breaking the Enigma cipher before the war. When Turing and his team at Bletchley Park in England began working on their own machine to break the Enigma code, they were inspired by the Polish machine and called their device the "Bombe" as a nod to the earlier work done by the Polish cryptanalysts..</p>
        <p>The development of the Bombe began in 1939, shortly after the start of World War II, and the first machine was operational by early 1940. However, the design was continually refined and improved throughout the war, with later versions being faster and more efficient.</p>
