        <h2>The Man That Broke The Enigma</h2>
        <img src="../2-tue/images/Alan-Turing.webp" alt="Alan-Turing">
        <p>Alan Turing (1912-1954) was a brilliant mathematician, logician, and computer scientist who is widely considered one of the most important figures in the history of computing. He is best known for his work during World War II as a codebreaker at Bletchley Park, where he helped decipher German communications, including the notorious Enigma code.</p>
        <p>Turing's contributions to the development of early computers and artificial intelligence were also groundbreaking. He proposed the concept of a universal machine that could perform any computational task, which became the basis for modern computers. Additionally, he developed the "Turing Test," a benchmark for measuring a machine's ability to exhibit human-like intelligence.</p>
        <p>Without Alan Turing, the world would probably be under a very different regime and there would most probably be no chatGPT to assist those of us not on Alan Turing's level of genius.</p>

        <h3>Fun Facts</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Saved the world as we know it</li>
            <li>Despite saving the world was persecuted for his sexuality</li>
            <li>In 2013, Queen Elizabeth II granted Turing a posthumous pardon for his conviction for homosexuality. A little late it would seem, and surely the man who saved the british empire from destruction could at least receive a knighthood especially as they hand them out to such high achieving actors and sports people</li>
