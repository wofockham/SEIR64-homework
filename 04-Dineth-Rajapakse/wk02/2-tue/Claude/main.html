            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Claude Elwood Shannon was born on April 30, 1916 in Petoskey, Michigan. After attending primary and secondary school in his neighboring hometown of Gaylord, he earned bachelors degrees in both electrical engineering and mathematics from the University of Michigan. After graduation, Shannon moved to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) to pursue his graduate studies. </p>
            <p>While at M.I.T., he worked with Dr. Vannevar Bush on one of the early calculating machines, the "differential analyzer," which used a precisely honed system of shafts, gears, wheels and disks to solve equations in calculus. Though analog computers like this turned out to be little more than footnotes in the history of the computer, Dr. Shannon quickly made his mark with digital electronics, a considerably more influential idea. </p>
            <p>In a prize-winning masters thesis completed in the Department of Mathematics, Shannon proposed a method for applying a mathematical form of logic called Boolean algebra to the design of relay switching circuits. This innovation, credited as the advance that transformed circuit design “from an art to a science,” remains the basis for circuit and chip design to this day. Shannon received both a master's degree in electrical engineering and his Ph.D. in mathematics from M.I.T. in 1940. </p>
