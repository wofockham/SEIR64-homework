        <p class="biography">
            Sophie Wilson is a British computer scientist and designer who is best known for designing the Acorn Micro-Computer, which later became the basis for the BBC Microcomputer. She was born on August 19, 1957, in Leeds, England.<br><br>

            Wilson attended the University of Cambridge, where she studied computer science and became interested in microprocessors. While still a student, she began working with Steve Furber on the design of the Acorn Micro-Computer. Together, they developed the ARM processor, which revolutionized the computing industry with its energy efficiency and processing power.<br><br>

            After graduating from Cambridge, Wilson continued to work for Acorn Computers, where she played a major role in the development of the BBC Microcomputer. Along with Steve Furber, she was instrumental in the design and production of Advanced RISC Machines (ARM), which became one of the most successful and influential computer processor design companies in the world.<br><br>

            Throughout her career, Wilson has been recognized for her contributions to the field of computer science. In 2019, she was awarded the Royal Society's prestigious Faraday Medal for her work in microprocessor design. She is also a fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering and the British Computer Society.<br><br>

            She now lives in Lode, Cambridge UK and enjoys photography and participating in the local drama group in her spare time.
