            <h2>More about John and his hometown</h2>
            <p>John von Neumann's hometown of Budapest was a major center of scientific and cultural activity during his lifetime. As a child, he grew up in a wealthy and intellectual family and received a rigorous education in mathematics and science.</p>
            <p>In Budapest, von Neumann was exposed to some of the leading scientists and mathematicians of the time, including Leo Szilard, Eugene Wigner, and George Polya. These individuals would later become his colleagues and collaborators in the United States.</p>
            <p>Von Neumann also attended the University of Budapest, where he earned degrees in chemical engineering and mathematics. He went on to study in Germany and Switzerland before eventually immigrating to the United States in the 1930s.</p>
            <p>Despite spending most of his career in the US, von Neumann remained connected to his Hungarian roots. He frequently traveled back to Budapest and maintained close ties with the scientific community there. In fact, he is still widely celebrated in Hungary today as one of the country's greatest scientific minds.</p>
