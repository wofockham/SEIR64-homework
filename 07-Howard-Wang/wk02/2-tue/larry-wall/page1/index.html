            <p>Larry Arnold Wall (born September 27, 1954) is an American computer programmer and author. He created the Perl programming language.

                Wall is a linguist, programmer, and author who grew up in Los Angeles and Washington before attending Seattle Pacific University. He later pursued graduate studies in linguistics at the University of California, Berkeley. Although health issues prevented him from creating a writing system for an unwritten language, Wall joined NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and became an active member of the New Life, Church of the Nazarene.
                
                He is known for developing the Perl interpreter and language, authoring the definitive resource, Programming Perl, and editing the Perl Cookbook. Wall has also made significant contributions to Usenet client 'rn' and the widely-used 'patch' program. He has received multiple awards for his work, including the first Free Software Foundation Award for the Advancement of Free Software in 1998. Wall's linguistic background and Christian faith have influenced Perl's design, terminology, and his speaking engagements.
